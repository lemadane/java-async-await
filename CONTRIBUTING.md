# Contributing to Jatot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Jatot! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 21** or later
- **Gradle 9.6.1** (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lemadane/jatot-lang.git
cd jatot-lang

# Build and run tests
./gradlew clean build
```

### Running the CLI

```bash
# Check a Jatot source file
./gradlew run --args="check examples/HelloJatot.jatot"

# Print the token stream
./gradlew run --args="tokens examples/HelloJatot.jatot"
```

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Write tests** for any new functionality or bug fixes.
3. **Follow the existing code style** — the project uses `-Xlint:all -Werror`, so the compiler will enforce warnings as errors.
4. **Keep commits focused** — each commit should address a single concern.
5. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API, CLI usage, or language features.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure `./gradlew clean build` passes with no warnings or errors.
2. Update the `README.md` if you've added new features or changed existing behavior.
3. Open a pull request against the `main` branch.
4. Describe your changes clearly in the PR description, including any design decisions and the motivation behind the change.

## Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lemadane/jatot-lang/issues) to report bugs or request features.
- Include a minimal `.jatot` code sample that demonstrates the issue, if applicable.
- Describe expected vs. actual behavior.

## Code Style

- Java 21 source level with `--release 21`.
- UTF-8 encoding.
- All compiler warnings are treated as errors (`-Xlint:all -Werror`).
- Use descriptive names; avoid abbreviations.
- Write Javadoc for public types and methods.
